**Project Description:**  
This project explores the spatial and temporal dynamics of ridefare pricing in Boston using real-world rideshare data. Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling, we aim to understand how time, location, and environmental factors influence trip prices — and build a model that can forecast them accurately.
